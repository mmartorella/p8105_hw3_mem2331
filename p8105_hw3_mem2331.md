# Problem 1

The Instacart data from 2017 has **1384617** orders, and it describes
these orders with **15** variables, some of which are: *order\_id*,
*product\_id*, *product\_name*, whether it was *reordered*, and the
*department\_id* and *aisle*. There are 134 aisles, and the fresh
vegetable and fresh fruit aisles are ordered from the most.

``` r
instacart %>% 
  count(aisle, sort = TRUE) %>% 
  filter(n > 10000) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(aisle, -n), y = n)) +
  geom_col() +
  ggtitle("Number of Instacart Orders by Aisle") +
  xlab("Aisle") +
  ylab("Number of Items Ordered") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, 
                                   hjust = 1))
```

Make a table showing the three most popular items in each of the aisles
“baking ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged vegetables
fruits”. Include the number of times each item is ordered in your
table.

``` r
instacart %>% 
  filter(aisle == c("baking ingredients", 
                    "dog food care", 
                    "packaged vegetables fruits")) %>% 
  group_by(aisle) %>% 
  count(product_name, sort = TRUE) %>% 
  filter(min_rank(desc(n)) <= 3) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = aisle,
              values_from = n) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```
